##🧠 Singly Linked List Implementation using OnlineGDB – Explanation & Real-World Use
As part of the CODTECH internship (Task 2), I developed a modular and efficient program in C language to implement a Singly Linked List 🔗. This project includes all the basic operations such as:

➕ Insertion (at the beginning, end, and after a specific node)

❌ Deletion (by value)

👁️‍🗨️ Traversal (to display the list)

The main goal was to build a clean, reusable, and understandable structure for handling data using linked lists—one of the core concepts in data structures 🧱.

🛠️ Tool Used – OnlineGDB
To write and test the code, I used OnlineGDB – a web-based IDE and compiler 🌐💻. It’s beginner-friendly and powerful, with a built-in terminal for input/output.

Why I chose OnlineGDB:

✅ No installation required

🧪 Easy real-time testing

🧑‍💻 Clean and simple UI

🔗 Allows sharing and saving code easily

I compiled and tested the program entirely online. A screenshot was taken to showcase how the code executes interactively, showing inputs, outputs, and a real-time simulation of linked list operations in a terminal-like environment 📸.

💡 Where Are Singly Linked Lists Used?
Singly linked lists are much more than just a concept taught in textbooks 📘. They're practical, memory-friendly, and used across different areas in software development:

🧠 Efficient Memory Management
Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t waste space. You can grow or shrink them dynamically as needed.

📚 Building Stacks & Queues
Essential for algorithms in compilers, expression evaluation, and scheduling tasks ⏳.

🎵 Music & Video Playlists
Each media file can link to the next, just like nodes in a list – ideal for streaming platforms and media players 🎶.

🚗 Navigation Systems
Locations or steps in a journey can be stored in a linked manner, making traversal and updates easy.

🖥️ Operating Systems
OS-level processes like memory allocation and task management use linked lists under the hood.

📘 Educational Purposes
A must-know for students, linked lists are the base for advanced structures like trees 🌳 and graphs 🌐.

🙌 Final Thoughts
This project gave me a solid understanding of how to manage dynamic memory, work with pointers, and write modular code in C 👨‍💻. Using OnlineGDB made coding and debugging very smooth and saved me from the hassle of installing compilers or setting up environments 🔧.

With this knowledge, I feel more confident moving ahead in the world of programming and data structures 💪. I'm proud to be completing this as part of the CODTECH internship, and I look forward to receiving my certificate of completion 🏆.

This isn’t just a project—it’s a practical skill that will help in competitive programming, interviews, and real-world software development ✨.
